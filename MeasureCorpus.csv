The ship disappeared with a crew of 644 men: sailors, soldiers and marines. It is a State Ship and a Collective Military Tomb.The history of human presence in Antarctica is very short and the remains of the San Telmo ship, if found, could be considered the first human remains in Antarctica. The ship and its artefacts are archaeologically significant in themselves, having been submerged for more than 100 years, which is a widely accepted international threshold for constituting underwater heritage. The wreck includes all parts and accessories related to the vessel, armaments, equipment, supplies, as well as the ship itself and the crew and military staff transported within. The designation also includes all the personal objects that the crew would have left in the ship when it sank.”Location: The location of the last sighting of the San Telmo vessel corresponds to 62ºS 70ºW, a point where the winds and currents inevitably lead north of Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands (Don Álvaro de Bazán General Archive of the Spanish Navy).Original Proposing Party: SpainParty undertaking management: Spain.",Measure 22,2021,ATCM XLIII,CEP XXIII,Paris

Any changes in the budget will have global consequences on atmospheric and oceanic circulation;(b) conditions beneath the ice shelves and the girdle of sea ice promote the formation of cold bottom water that drains northward;(c) polar seas play an especially important role in the exchange of CO2 between ocean and atmosphere since they may be large sinks for CO2.  These processes are controlled by the sea-ice formation, thermohaline convection and biological productivity;(d) Antarctica provides unique conditions for investigating the impact of man-made pollutants on atmospheric ozone;(e) a detailed record of past global climate and atmospheric chemistry extending over hundreds of millennia is preserved within the Antarctic ice sheet, and in the sediments of the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic continent;(f) because climate change is predicted to be largest at high latitudes, detection of such change above the background of high natural variability is best sought in the polar regions;(g) plant communities existing under polar conditions are sensitive to changes in temperature, and may be good indicators of climate change;(h) the Antarctic ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea level world-wide some 60 metres.  Any greenhouse climate warning which makes even a small change to this volume of ice will have a significant impact on sea level:Recognizing, with appreciation, that the contribution that Antarctic science can make to these scientific questions is the subject of intensive work within the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and that they have identified the following five major, interconnected, interdisciplinary research thrusts for the purpose of defining and encompassing research priorities :(a) Detection of Changes of Global Importance Best Observed in Antarctica;(b) Processes Linking Antarctic Ice and Biological Systems to the Global Ocean and Atmosphere;(c) Antarctic Sources of Palaeoenvironmental Information;(d) Ecology in the Changing Antarctic Environment;(e) Monitoring Changes in Antarctica;Recognising, moreover, that other scientific programmes which are not so directly relevant to issues of global change are of no less value to science;Conscious of the need to ensure that all Antarctic activity is based on information adequate to ensure that informed judgements can be made about their environmental consequences;Renew their commitment to the pursuit of scientific research in the Antarctic; andDeclare their intent:1.

The following wastes shall be removed from the Antarctic Treaty area unless they are incinerated in equipment which neutralizes the harmful emissions that would otherwise be produced:(a) poly-vinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane foam, polystyrene foam, rubber and lubricating oils which contain additives that are widely recognized as products that could produce harmful emissions;(b) all other plastic wastes, including those of unknown composition.13.  The following wastes shall be removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area to the maximum extent practicable:(a) liquid wastes, other than sewage and domestic liquid wastes;(b) solid, non-combustible wastes; and(c) fuel drums.14.  The following wastes shall be removed from Antarctic Treaty area unless incinerated, autoclaved or otherwise treated to be made sterile:(a) residues of introduced animal carcasses;(b) cultures of micro-organisms; and(c) introduced avian products.15.  Combustible wastes, not removed from the Antarctic Treaty area, shall be burnt in incinerators designed to reduce harmful emissions to the maximum extent practicable.16.  All open burning of wastes shall be phased out.  Pending the completion of such phase out, when it is necessary to dispose of wastes by open burning:(a) allowance shall be made for the wind and the type of wastes to be burnt to limit, as far as practicable, particulate deposition on land and to avoid such deposition over sensitive areas; and(b) wastes to be burnt shall be stored in such as way as to prevent their dispersal by wind, or access and dispersal by scavengers.17.  All wastes to be removed from the Antarctic Treaty area, or otherwise disposed of, shall be stored in such a way as to prevent their dispersal by wind or access and dispersal by scavengers.18.  Solid non-combustible wastes, which cannot be removed to land disposal sites outside the Antarctic Treaty area and which are to be disposed of at sea, shall only be disposed of at selected dump sites in deep waters, within or outside the Antarctic Treaty area and only in accordance with the international Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by the Dumping of Wastes and other Matter (London Dumping Convention), as well as any other relevant international agreements.19.  Dumping of any other wastes at sea shall be carried out in accordance with the London Dumping Convention.20.  Sewage, chemical wastes and, to the maximum extent practicable, domestic liquid wastes shall not be disposed of onto ice free land.  Sewage and domestic liquid wastes may be discharged directly into the ocean, provided that:(a) such discharge be located, wherever practicable, where conditions exist for rapid dispersal;(b) large quantities of such wastes (generated by approximately 30 individuals or more), receive at least primary treatment, such as maceration; and(c) consideration be given to the advantages of treating very large quantities through systems, such as Rotating Biological Contractor Systems, to reduce biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids.21.  Vessels engaged in supporting Antarctic activities that are not fitted with incinerator facilities shall, to the maximum extent practicable, stockpile waste, excluding untreated sewage and domestic effluents, for appropriate disposal at stations, bases, deep waters sites or outside of the Antarctic Treaty area, provided that such wastes may be disposed of at stations or bases in Antarctica only in accordance with these practices, and at sea only in accordance with relevant Antarctic Treaty recommendations, the London Dumping Convention and any other relevant international agreements.  Any incineration of shipboard wastes in the Antarctic Treaty area shall be conducted in incinerators of the type which are designed to reduce harmful emissions to the maximum extent practicable.22.  Those carrying out activities in Antarctica shall to the maximum extent practicable clean up the waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites of their Antarctic activities.23.  Wastes generated at inland stations shall be removed from the area of such stations to the maximum extent practicable for disposal in accordance with the practices set out in this Recommendation.  Where this is not practicable, such wastes shall be concentrated in deep ice pits.  In planning the location of inland stations where deep ice pits are the only practicable alternative, sites on known ice flow lines which terminate at ice-free areas or in areas of high ablation shall be avoided.24.  Wherever practicable, wastes generated at field camps shall be removed to their supporting stations, bases or ships for disposal in accordance with the practices set out in this Recommendation.Procedures25.  These practices shall be kept under continuing review so as to ensure that they are up-dated as necessary to reflect improvements in waste disposal technology and procedures and to ensure maximum protection of the Antarctic environment.  To this end it would be desirable for SCAR and the Managers of National Antarctic Programs to continue to consider problems, prospects and opportunities for cooperation in Antarctic waste management and to provide advice on appropriate steps that may be taken.26.  Governments should ensure that their nationals and vessels are subject to measures governing waste disposal in Antarctica that are no less effective in affording protection of the environment than those applicable to their nationals and vessels outside Antarctica.  Further, nothing in these practices shall be interpreted as replacing national environmental standards applicable to Antarctic activities, where such standards are stricter than those contained in these practices; nor shall any provision in these practices be interpreted as limiting governments from adopting stricter standards.27.  These practices shall not be interpreted or implemented in such fashion as to endanger human life.",,1989,ATCM XV,,
